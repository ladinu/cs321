"""Module to generate random sentences from a grammar.  The grammar consists of
entries that can be written as S = 'NP VP | S and S', which gets translated to
{'S': [['NP', 'VP'], ['S', 'and', 'S']]}, and means that one of the top-level
lists will be chosen at random, and then each element of the second-level list
will be rewritten; if it is not in the grammar it rewrites as itself.  The
functions rewrite and rewrite_tree take as input a list of words and an
accumulator (empty list) to which the results are appended.  The function
generate and generate_tree are convenient interfaces to rewrite and rewrite_tree
that accept a string (which defaults to 'S') as input."""

# A drawback of this simple recursive program is that, since python
# doesn't recognize tail recursion, deeply recursive programs can run
# out of stack space. So w increase max stack size from 8MB to 16MB
# and recursion limit to 1M!  You may have to coment out these lines
# if you are on a mac and have not reset the limts.
